This project is a continuing personal exercise in exploring web service concepts in C++. 

Initially I wanted to better understand the http protocol and asynchronous I/O and started from this base:
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_56_0/doc/html/boost_asio/examples/cpp03_examples.html

As I built out the simple http server, I wanted to investigate web service frameworks (and language tradeoffs) started to build out a layer on top of the http server based on:
http://expressjs.com/

For unit testing I explored a framework which I had not used before: 
https://code.google.com/p/googletest/

I also tried to incorporate and learn some C++11 concepts along the way.

Directory structure:
myhttp/ - Implementation of rudimentary http server and web service layer
myhttp-test/ - Very incomplete project of unit tests for myhttp
example-middleware/ - One very simple example implemented on top of myhttp
